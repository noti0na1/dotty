   *  and its extensions. Only open classes need to specify such a contract.
   *  Ad-hoc extensions might break for future versions of the extended class,
   *  since the extended class is free to change its implementation without
   *  being constrained by an internal contract.
   *
   *  '''Why allow it?''' An ad-hoc extension can sometimes be necessary,
   *  for instance when mocking a class in a testing framework, or to work
   *  around a bug or missing feature in the original class. Nevertheless,
   *  such extensions should be limited in scope and clearly documented.
   *  That's why the language import is required for them.
